# Diabetes-prediction-using-SVM
With the aid of machine learning, we are developing a system that can determine whether a person has diabetes or not. Python is used to do this task. In this project, the prediction is made using the Support Vector Machine model.
Numpy and Panda are the Python libraries that are used. Additionally, certain features, such as StandardScaler from pre-processing, train_test_split from model selection and accuracy score from metrics are also present in the project. The data set has been taken from Kaggle.
